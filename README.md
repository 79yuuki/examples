# Riot Examples

Demos and examples for [Riot](http://riotjs.com/) and submodules.
This repository is maintained by Riot community.

*Note: we're preparing this repo for next Riot v2.3 release.*

## Playground

This is the simplest example, and also an easy tutorial. Let's start this from [here](#under-construction). Read the comment inside the code, write a few line, then you'll be an expert of Riot.js!

- [Playground](playground)

## Basics

We have several examples for the beginners. These are relatively well tested by users and collaborators.

- [Todo App](todo-app)
- [Todo App (pre-compiled)](todo-app-precompiled)
- Timer
- [Router - Page switcher](router-page-switcher)

and more (maybe soon)
