**Semicolons**<br>

**Spacing**<br>
Use two spaces for indentation. No tabs.
Spacing around brackets: `if (foo) {` instead of `if(foo){`

**Quotes**<br>
Single-quoted strings are preferred to double-quoted strings.

**Equality Checking**<br>
Prefer `==` over `===` unless it's a must.

**Bitwise Operations**<br>
Prefer classic conditionals `i < 0` over bitwise operators `!~pos`
